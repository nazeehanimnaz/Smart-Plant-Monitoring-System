# Theory behind Soil Moisture Sensor

There are a few types of soil moisture sensors. 
The one used for this practical has two parts; the soil moisture probe and an electronic module.
The probe looks like a fork and acts as a variable resistor. 
It has two pins which should be connected to the two pins of the electronic module.
The resistance of the probes varies according to the wetness of the soil.
When the soil is wet, it has water, which induces a small amount of current. 
According to Ohm's law, resistance and current are inversely proportional to each other.
Hence due to this formation of current, the resistance of the probes would decrease.
Alternatively, when the soil is dry and no or less water is detected in the soil, then the resistance of the probes would increase.
Therefore, it is important to note that the value of the resistance of the probe is the output collected from the sensor and not the amount of moisture in the soil.
